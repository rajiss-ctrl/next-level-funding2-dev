                When you visit the site, we automatically collect certain
                information about your device, including information about your
                web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that
                are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the
                site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
                products that you view, what websites or search terms referred
                you to the site, and information about how you interact with the
                site. We refer to this automatically collected information as
                “Device Information.”

                We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
              </h3>
              <p>
                – “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or
                computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For
                more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,
                visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. – “Log files” track
                actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your
                IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
                referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. – “Web beacons,”
                “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record
                information about how you browse the Site. Additionally, when
                you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the
                site, we collect certain information from you, including your
                name, billing address, shipping address, payment information
                (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone
                number. We refer to this information as “Order Information.” All
                payment related information is collected and processed by third
                party providers (PayPal, Stripe, World Remit, etc.) and we do
                not maintain a copy of that information within our systems. When
                we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
                are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.

                We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfil
                any orders placed through the Site (including processing your
                payment information and providing you with invoices and/or order
                confirmations). We use the Device Information that we collect to
                help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your
                IP address), and more generally to improve and optimise our site
                (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers
                browse and interact with the site, and to assess the success of
                our promotional campaigns).
