Repeated Failure to place a stop loss shortly after the trade is opened will result in a violation of your live account so be sure to use a stop loss.

                text={`We require our traders have a minimum of 5 tradings days on all live accounts while risking +\- 0.5% risk for all trades.

              For example if you are taking a trade at 0.5% then your next trade is at 2% this is not consistent. Your trades need to be similar risk by +\-0.5%. So if you open a trade at 0.5% risk it is ok on your next trade to risk 1%. Another example , if you open a trade at 1% risk it is then ok to take your next trade at 0.5% or 1.5%. The reason for this rule is it stops people gambling. Most traders can take one trade and get lucky this is not what we are looking for , we are looking for profitable traders that can properly manage risk.
              
              Also as part of our consistency rule one trade cannot be over 50% of your total profit. For example if you have a 100k account and you take 5 trades:
            
              Trade 1 = 200$ profit
              Trade 2 = 400$ profit
              Trade 3 = 275$ profit
              Trade 4 = 600$ profit
              Trade 5 = 5000$ profit
              
              This also is not consistent and inconsistent trades will be deducted from your total payout. You can take as long as you want to reach these 5 minimum trading days also. We find these rules fair as we allow you to use the HFT algo to pass our challenge and in return we Expect that you follow a set of rules to prove you are not just gambling your way through your account.`}
