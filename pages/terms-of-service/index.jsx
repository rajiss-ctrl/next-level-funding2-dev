                inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service

                affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service
                providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or
                any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or
                consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation
                lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data,
                replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in
                contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or
                otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any
                products procured using the service, or for any other claim

                liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such

              <p>
                Once you dispute an order payment it has an adverse impact on
                the company, financially, and causes a damage to our company
                profile in the eyes of the Payment Gateway. Hence, according to
                our policy, we will be banning accounts (directly involved in
                the dispute/against the same order number) of traders who
                dispute their payments and moving forward we will not entertain
                any requests to unban the accounts(s). The user who is involved
                in a disputed transaction in the normal course of the business,
                where there has not been any problem on our side, such users
                wont be eligible for any futher accounts with Nextlevelfunding
                and all their other active accounts, with current balance over
                and above the initial balance, will be refunded as well. This
                policy is in place to protect Nextlevelfunding from any
                financial adversity as well as to ensure the long term viability
                of the brand name.
